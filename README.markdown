This is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and other IDEs base on Intellij platform.

What does it do?
----------------
It quickly opens temporary IntelliJ text editor tab. Data is stored on application level.
Usage: Alt+C, Alt+C - opens default scratch; Alt+C, Alt+S - opens list of all scratches.

Some history
------------
The motivation for this plugin was that there are situations when you want to edit some text
but it doesn't really deserve a separate file. I've seen people having a notepad (or notepad++)
window open with a temporary file in which they dump this kind of text.

Initial version of this plugin was written in 2009 during lunch time and immediately went live.
There have been virtually no new functionality added since then. In a way it's a good thing because
I think it does what it should do and nothing else. Another good thing is that over 3 years
it took about 20 hours to support this plugin but I use it every day. Huge payoff.
